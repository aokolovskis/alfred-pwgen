# Alfred Password Generator #

Generate secure random passwords from Alfred. Uses `/dev/urandom` as source of entropy.

![Alfred Password Generator Demo](./demo.gif "Alfred Password Generator Demo")


## Features ##

- Passwords can be generated based on strength or length.
- Offers multiple generators, including based on real words and pronounceable pseudo-words generated with Markov chains.
- Shows the strength of each generated password.


## Usage ##

- `pwgen [<strength>]` — Generate passwords of specified strength. Default is `3` (96 bits of entropy). See [Password strength](#password-strength) for details.
    - `↩` or `⌘+C` — Copy the selected password to the clipboard.
    - `⌘+↩` — Copy the selected password to the clipboard and paste it to the frontmost application.
    - `⌘+L` — Show the selected password in Alfred's Large Text window.
- `pwlen [<length>]` — Generate passwords of specified length. Default is `20`. See [Password strength](#password-strength) for details.
    - `↩` or `⌘+C` — Copy the selected password to the clipboard.
    - `⌘+↩` — Copy the selected password to the clipboard and paste it to the frontmost application.
    - `⌘+L` — Show the selected password in Alfred's Large Text window.
- `pwconf [<query>]` — View and edit workflow settings. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

**Note:** Word-based generators may provide passwords that are slightly longer than `<length>`.


## Password strength ##

Passwords can be specified either by strength or length. The default strength is `3`, which is at least 96 bits of entropy (each level is 32 bits). You may also specify the desired number of bits by appending `b` to your input, e.g. `pwgen 128b` will provide at least 128 bits of entropy.

Default length is 20 characters, which can provide ~50 to ~130 bits of entropy depending on generator.

Each password has its strength in the result subtitle. This is shown either as a bar or in bits of entropy, depending on your settings. Each full block in the bar represents 30 bits of entropy.


### How strong should my passwords be? ###

That depends on what you're using it for and how long you want it to remain secure. As of 2015, custom password-guessing hardware (built from standard PC components) can guess **&gt;45 billion passwords per second.**

The average number of guesses required to crack a password with *n* bits of entropy is 2<sup>n-1</sup>, so 2,147,483,647 guesses for a 32-bit password. Or **0.048 seconds** with the above hardware.

Fortunately, every added bit doubles the number of possible passwords, so 64 bits is a good deal stronger: 6.5 **years** on average to guess on the same hardware.

| Level   | Min. entropy          | Time to guess&nbsp;\*                         | Application                               |
| ------: | --------------------: | --------------:                               | ---------------------------               |
| 1       | 32&nbsp;bits          | 0.048 seconds                                 | Stuff you want to be super easy to crack? |
| 2       | 64&nbsp;bits          | 6.5 years                                     | Web accounts, WiFi passwords              |
| 3       | 96&nbsp;bits          | 280 million years                             | Almost anything                           |
| 4       | 128&nbsp;bits         | billions of times the age of the universe | Encryption keys                           |

\* = based on 45 billions guesses per second.

The default password strength level of 3 (96 bits) provides very secure passwords.

The default password length of 20 characters provides reasonably to very secure passwords, depending on the generator.


#### Displayed strength ####

By default, the strength of generated passwords is shown as a bar in the result subtitle. Each full block represents 32 bits of entropy, so 2 blocks represents a pretty secure password, 3 or more a very secure password.

You can have the precise number of bits displayed instead by toggling the "Strength Bar" setting in the [Configuration](#configuration) (keyword `pwconf`).


#### How can passwords of the same strength have different levels of security? ####

Passwords of the same length (or even the self-same password) generated using different techniques have different strengths because the strength is determined by the permutations in the algorithm and the password length.

For example, the single-digit password `1` has an entropy of 3.32 bits when generated by the Numeric algorithm because it is one of only 10 possible one-digit passwords. The same password generated by the ASCII algorithm has an entropy of 5.95 bits because it is one of 62 possible one-character passwords.

See [Password strength on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Random_passwords) for more information.


## Configuration ##

Access the configuraton options with the `pwconf` keyword. You can use an optional query to filter the available options, e.g. use `pwconf gen` to show only the available generators.

The following configuraton options are available:


### Open Help ###

Action this item to open this README in your browser.


### An Update is Available / No Update is Available ###

The workflow checks for a new version once a day. If one is available, "An Update is Available" will be shown. Action this item to install the update.

If no update is available, "No Update is Available" will be shown. Action this item to force a check for an update.


### Default Password Strength ###

The default strength for passwords generated with `pwgen`. For strength *n*, passwords will have *n\*32* bits of entropy. Default is `3`, which should be proof against anything but the NSA. `4` will generate extremely secure passwords.

Action this item to enter a new default strength.


### Default Password Length ###

The default length in characters for passwords generated with `pwlen`. The default of `20` provides passwords that are reasonably to very secure, depending on the generator.

Action this item to enter a new default length.


### Strength Bar ###

By default, password strength is indicated by a number of blocks. Each full block represents 32 bits of entropy, so 3 blocks is secure, 4 is very secure. Less that 3 blocks should be avoided.

Alternatively, strength can be shown as the number of bits of entropy.

Action this item to toggle the strength bar on/off.


### Generators ###

All the available generators are listed below the other options.

Active generators have a checked green circle as their icon, inactive ones have an empty red circle icon.

Action a generator to toggle it on or off.

## Built-in generators ##

The workflow includes 10 built-in generators, of which 6 are active by default. You can activate/deactivate them in the [Configuration](#configuration).


### Active generators ###

These generators are active by default.

#### ASCII Generator ####

Generates passwords based on all ASCII characters, minus a few punctuation marks that can be hard to type, such as `\\`, `\``, `~`.


#### Alphanumeric Generator ####

Generates passwords from ASCII letters and digits. No punctuation.


#### Clear Alphanumeric Generator ####

Generates passwords from ASCII letters and digits, excluding easily-confused characters `1`, `l`, `O`, `0` (lowercase L, uppercase O, the digits 1 and 0).


#### Numeric Generator ####

Generates digit-only passwords.


#### Pronounceable Nonsense Generator ####

Generates pronounceable passwords based on nonsense words. Based on [this GitHub comment](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5502875).


#### Dictionary Generator ####

Generates passwords based on the words in `/usr/share/dict/words`.


### Inactive generators ###

These generators are inactive by default. They can be turned on in the [Configuration](#configuration).


#### Pronounceable Markov Generator ####

Generates semi-pronounceable passwords based on Markov chains and the start of *A Tale of Two Cities*.

Has slightly more entropy than the [Pronounceable Nonsense generator](#pronounceable-nonsense-generator), but the passwords aren't quite as pronounceable.


#### German Generator ####

Generate passwords using all ASCII characters (including punctuation), plus German characters (esset, umlauts).


#### German Alphanumeric Generator ####

Generate passwords using all ASCII characters (without punctuation), plus German characters (esset, umlauts).


#### German Pronounceable Markov Generator ####

Generates semi-pronounceable passwords based on Markov chains and the start of *Buddenbrooks*.
